A social isolation index was constructed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) applied to a set of nominal items capturing perceived exclusion, emotional isolation, and restrictive or neglectful interpersonal environments. The MCA included the following questions: “How often do you feel silenced and excluded by others?”, “How often do you feel completely alone?”, “Has someone forbidden you from going out or receiving visitors?”, “How often did an adult in your home show love, support, and care?”, “Has someone humiliated or ridiculed you?”, and “Has someone stopped providing for your basic needs despite having money?” Dimension 1 accounted for the largest share of variance (38.46%) and was therefore used as the primary score for the composite index, effectively capturing the latent continuum of social isolation versus social support. Each participant’s Dim1 score represents their relative position along this continuum, with higher values indicating closer proximity to category combinations characteristic of greater isolation, and lower values reflecting patterns associated with social support and inclusion
