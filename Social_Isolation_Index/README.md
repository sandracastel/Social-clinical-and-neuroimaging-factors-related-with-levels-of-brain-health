<h1 style="text-align: center;">Social Isolation Index (MCA-Based)</h1>

A social isolation index was derived using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), a multivariate technique suited for summarizing the latent structure of categorical data. Five items assessing dimensions of social isolation and adverse interpersonal experiences were included in the analysis: frequency of feeling silenced or excluded (uls_2), frequency of feeling completely alone (uls_3), exposure to mobility restriction by others (msoc_forb), experiences of humiliation (msoc_humi), and deprivation of basic needs despite the availability of resources (msoc_prov). The full list of variables and their response categories is provided in Table S1.

MCA decomposed the joint variability of these indicators into orthogonal dimensions. The first dimension (Dim 1) captured the dominant underlying pattern of association across items, explaining 38.5% of the total inertia (Table S2). Coordinates of individual response categories on Dim 1 and Dim 2 indicated that the highest positive loadings corresponded to categories reflecting greater social isolation and interpersonal adversity, whereas negative loadings represented lower exposure (Table S3). All five variables showed strong contributions to Dim 1 (η² = 1.00 for each variable), confirming that this first axis effectively summarized the shared structure across indicators (Table S4).

Individual MCA scores on Dim 1 were extracted and used as the composite index of social isolation. Higher scores reflect a profile characterized by clustering in categories associated with greater isolation. To facilitate comparability across models, the index was standardized (mean = 0, SD = 1). Descriptive statistics of the raw and standardized scores are reported in Table S5.

This index was subsequently used as a continuous predictor in the main analyses to quantify the degree of social isolation experienced by participants.
