<h1 style="text-align: center;">Social support Index (MCA-Based)</h1>

A social support index was constructed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) applied to three categorical indicators capturing complementary aspects of perceived social connectedness (Table S1). The first indicator was the total score derived from three UCLA-based items assessing how often participants feel hungry for companionship (uls_1), silenced or excluded by others (uls_2), and completely alone (uls_3), each scored on a three-level frequency scale (1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = frequently). The second indicator captured the frequency of contact with close loved ones (msoc_contact; 1 = <1 time/week, 2 = 1–2 times/week, 3 = 3–5 times/week, 4 = >5 times/week). The third measured perceived courtesy or respect received from others (msoc_52rev; 1 = less courteous, 2 = neither more nor less courteous, 3 = more courteous).

MCA decomposed the multivariate associations across these indicators into orthogonal latent dimensions. The first dimension (Dim 1) explained 20% of the total inertia (Table S2) and represented the primary social support gradient. Category coordinates on Dimensions 1 and 2 (Table S3) showed clear clustering of high-support categories (e.g., frequent contact, high courtesy) toward positive values on Dim 1, whereas response patterns associated with lower support (e.g., fewer weekly interactions, reduced courtesy, higher loneliness) clustered toward negative values. All variables exhibited maximal contributions to Dim 1 (η² = 1.00; Table S4), supporting its role as the dominant latent dimension summarizing perceived support.

Individual scores on Dim 1 were extracted and standardized to construct the final social support index (mean = 0, SD = 1). As shown in Table S5, the distribution of the index was highly concentrated around a single category (median = –0.085), with minimal interquartile variability (IQR ≈ 0). However, a small subset of individuals exhibited markedly higher values (maximum = 11.73), indicating the presence of a minority subgroup characterized by exceptionally strong perceived social support. This pattern produced an elevated standard deviation despite limited variability in the majority of the sample. Overall, the index effectively captured both the predominant uniformity in support levels as well as the presence of a small high-support subgroup, highlighting heterogeneity that would be masked by unidimensional raw scores.
