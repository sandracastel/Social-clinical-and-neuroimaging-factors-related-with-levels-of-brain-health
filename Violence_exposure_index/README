A violence exposure index was constructed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to summarize the multidimensional pattern of adverse and coercive experiences reported by participants. Fourteen variables capturing political violence, criminal victimization, coercion, exploitation, and interpersonal abuse were included (Table S1). These variables comprised: political violence or repression (msoc_45rev_2), assault or attempted robbery outside the home (msoc_45rev_3), robbery inside the home (msoc_45rev_4), exposure to man-made disasters (msoc_45rev_5), situations of perceived threat to life (msoc_45rev_6), witnessing severe injury or death outside work (msoc_45rev_7), contact with dead bodies outside funerary contexts (msoc_45rev_8), firearm or weapon attacks (msoc_att), humiliation (msoc_humi), mobility restriction (msoc_forb), deprivation of basic needs (msoc_prov), unauthorized handling of money (msoc_mon), coercion regarding property (msoc_prop), and sexual coercion (msoc_deman). All items were coded as multinomial categorical responses (0 = no exposure, 1 = exposure, –99 = unknown).

The MCA identified one dominant latent dimension representing cumulative violence exposure. Dimension 1 accounted for 50.0% of the total inertia, whereas subsequent dimensions each explained considerably smaller proportions of variance (Dim 2: 9.7%; Dim 3: 8.5%) (Table S2). Given its clear interpretability and substantially higher contribution, Dimension 1 was retained as the basis for the violence index.

Category coordinates demonstrated that endorsing any exposure category (value = 1) loaded strongly and positively on Dimension 1 across all variables, whereas non-exposure (value = 0) showed negative loadings near zero, confirming a gradient from minimal to high cumulative violence (Table S3). The eta² decomposition indicated that the variables contributing most strongly to Dimension 1 were perceived threat to life (msoc_45rev_6; η² = 0.360), witnessing severe injury/death (msoc_45rev_7; η² = 0.291), weapon assault (msoc_att; η² ≈ 0.29), robbery or assault events (msoc_45rev_3, msoc_45rev_4; η² = 0.27–0.29), humiliation and coercion (msoc_humi, msoc_forb; η² ≈ 0.19–0.20), and other adversities with moderate contributions (Table S4). This pattern is consistent with a severity-weighted gradient of violent and coercive experiences.

Each participant received a violence exposure score corresponding to their coordinate on Dimension 1. Descriptive statistics (Table S5) showed a highly skewed distribution, with most participants clustering at the minimal exposure level (median = –0.086; IQR = 0). However, the index captured substantial variability at the upper end (maximum = 11.76; SD = 1.00), representing individuals with multiple concurrent or severe exposures. The index was also standardized (z-score) for use in regression models.
