To quantify household socioeconomic position, we constructed an economic index using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), a multivariate technique suited for summarizing patterns of association across categorical indicators. Fifteen binary variables capturing the availability of household assets and essential services over the past 12 months were included (Table S1), encompassing electricity, radio, television, refrigerator, washing machine, landline phone, water heater, indoor bathroom, running water, personal vehicle, computer, internet access, sound system, smartphone, and number of bedrooms.

The MCA was performed using the first dimension as the primary socioeconomic gradient. Eigenvalues and variance decomposition are reported in Table S2. Dimension 1 accounted for 48.93% of total inertia, substantially more than any subsequent dimension (Dim 2 = 12.76%; Dim 3 = 7.39%), indicating a strong unidimensional structure in which household amenities co-varied along a single socioeconomic axis. The cumulative variance exceeded 69% by the third dimension, but Dim 1 alone captured the dominant socioeconomic pattern and was therefore retained for index construction.

Category coordinates on Dimensions 1 and 2 (Table S3) followed the expected socioeconomic gradient. Absence of each asset (coded “0”) showed negative coordinates on Dim 1, clustering tightly between −0.088 and −0.084, while presence of the asset (“1”) showed coordinates near zero. Missing categories (“NA”), as expected in MCA, displayed extreme positive coordinates (≈11.72), reflecting their low frequency rather than substantive socioeconomic meaning.

Variable contributions (eta²) to Dim 1 are shown in Table S4. Most household-asset variables exhibited extremely high contributions (Dim1 eta² ≈ 0.99), confirming that Dimension 1 represents a broad, cohesive socioeconomic gradient. The number of bedrooms (msoc_bedr_rec) contributed moderately (eta² = 0.695), suggesting partial independence from other household assets, whereas higher-order amenities such as internet access, washing machine, or computer ownership showed sizeable contributions to Dimensions 2 and 3, indicating secondary structure beyond the main socioeconomic axis.

The MCA-derived economic index corresponded to the coordinate of each participant on Dimension 1. Descriptive statistics of the index (Table S5) showed a highly left-skewed distribution: the median score was −0.087, with interquartile range 0.004, indicating that most participants shared similar levels of basic household infrastructure. A small number of extreme positive values (Max = 11.59) reflected individuals associated with rare or missing categories, a characteristic typical of MCA scaling. The standard deviation was 0.911, and percentiles confirmed extreme concentration around the lower bound (P1–P10 ≈ −0.087), with slightly larger variation only at the extreme upper tail.
